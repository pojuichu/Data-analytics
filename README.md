# Data-analytics

This project aim to find correlation, linearality, machine learning insights for different element in strain, vicker hardness etc in the semiconductor dataset. 

Most of the first step is data cleaning them reducing from PCA, CCA, neural network machine learning applications.

Clustering_PoJuiChu demonstrate KMENA, TSNE application on the dataset resultings in two clusters.

RandomForest_PoJuiChu use random forest to generate a Classification report for precision and accuracy visualization of semiconductor dataset classifications.

ANN-based-on-RF is neural network training with train the model for 150 epochs with a mini-batch size of 32 samples; we may alter these 2 hyperparameters. Bias and weighted included.

Independent study  is standoff project that utilzied three analytics methods of linear regression, classification TSNE, and nerual network to compare and find correlation, linearality insight into stainless steel cracking in element components.
